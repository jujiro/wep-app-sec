# wep-app-sec
A compact ASP.Net application to learn about securing web applications and apis.

## Introduction
Being a developer for over three decades I have been dealing with with the new keywords, terminology, along with the new and exciting technology, all the time.  Being an old-timer, and a strong proponent of KISS (Keep It Simple and Stupid,) I sometimes feel lost.  In those situations, I try to simplify stuff for others like me, who perhaps can benefit with my work.  This project is along the same lines.

If you are new to this subject, I suggest you to watch a very simple slideshow I prepared on this topic.

## What you will learn ##
Using this project you will learn pretty much how OAUTH works, though the project itself does not use it.

The following items are covered in the project.
* Forcing https for your site
* Password validation against stored hash
* Returning a token after authentication
* Using token for for subsequent conversation
* Maintaining the tokens on the server side using a simple thread safe list
* Securing Api methods
* Adding added authorization to Api methods so that only selected users can use it
