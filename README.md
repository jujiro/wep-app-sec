# wep-app-sec
A compact ASP.Net application to learn about securing web applications and apis.

## Introduction
Being a developer for over three decades I have beed bombarded constantly with new keywords and terminology, along with the new and exciting technology.  Being an old-timer and a strong proponent of KISS (Keep It Simple and Stupid,) I often feel lost.  It's not that I am past my expiration date to learn new stuff.  So, my way to get into the new stuff is to simplify it.  This project is along the same lines.

If you are new to this subject, I suggest you to watch a very simple slideshow I prepared on this topic.

Using this project you will learn pretty much how oauth works, though the project by itself does not use it.

The following items are covered in the project.
* Password validation against stored hash
* Returning a token after authentication
* Using token for for subsequent conversation
* Maintaining the tokens on the server side using a simple thread safe list
* Forcing https for your site
* Securing Apis
* Adding added authorization to Api methods so that only selected users can use it
